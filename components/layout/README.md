# Layout Components

This directory contains components that define the structure and layout of the application. These components are responsible for organizing content and providing navigation.

## Components in this directory:

-   `TabNavigation.tsx`: Navigation tabs for switching between different views
-   `ActionBar.tsx`: The action bar containing buttons and controls
-   Other components related to page layout and structure

When adding new components to this directory, ensure they are:

1. Related to the overall application layout
2. Focused on structuring content rather than implementing business logic
3. Reusable across different parts of the application
