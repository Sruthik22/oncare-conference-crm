# UI Components

This directory contains low-level UI components that are used throughout the application. These components are typically small, reusable, and stateless. They should not contain business logic or be tied to specific features.

## Components in this directory:

-   `Icon.tsx`: A component for rendering icons
-   `checkbox.tsx`: A component for rendering checkboxes
-   Other basic UI building blocks

When adding new components to this directory, ensure they are:

1. Reusable across features
2. Not tied to specific business logic
3. Focused on presentation rather than behavior
