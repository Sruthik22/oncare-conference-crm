# React Hooks

This directory contains custom React hooks that provide reusable logic across the application. The hooks are organized into subdirectories based on their purpose.

## Subdirectories:

-   `api/`: Hooks related to API calls and data fetching
-   `features/`: Hooks related to specific application features
-   `ui/`: Hooks related to UI components and interactions

## Good Practices for Hooks:

1. **Single Responsibility**: Each hook should have a single, clear purpose
2. **Reusability**: Hooks should be designed to be reused across components
3. **Naming**: Use the `use` prefix for all hooks
4. **Dependencies**: Clearly document the dependencies of each hook
5. **Error Handling**: Include proper error handling in hooks that perform operations that might fail

When adding new hooks, consider whether they're general enough to be useful in multiple components or if they're specific to a single component. If they're very specific, they might belong within the component file instead.
