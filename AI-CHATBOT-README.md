# AI Query for OnCare CRM

This document explains how to use the new AI query feature in OnCare CRM.

## Overview

The AI query feature allows you to search and filter your data using natural language. Instead of manually setting up complex filters, you can simply ask questions in plain English, and the AI will translate your request into appropriate filters.

## Getting Started

There are two ways to use the AI feature:

### Option 1: AI Query Mode

1. In the search bar section, click the "AI Query" tab to switch from regular search to AI mode
2. Type your question or request in the new AI search field
3. The AI will respond and automatically apply relevant filters to your data
4. If you ask follow-up questions, the interface will expand into a conversation

### Option 2: AI Assistant

1. Look for the sparkle icon (âœ¨) in the bottom right corner of your screen
2. Click the icon to open the chat interface
3. Type your question or request
4. The AI will respond and automatically apply relevant filters to your data

## Example Queries

Here are some examples of questions you can ask:

### For Attendees

-   "Show me all attendees from hospitals in New York"
-   "Find attendees with the title 'Chief Medical Officer'"
-   "Which attendees are from health systems with revenue over 5B?"
-   "Show me all attendees with gmail email addresses"

### For Health Systems

-   "Which health systems are located in California?"
-   "Find health systems with annual revenue greater than $1 billion"
-   "Show me health systems on the east coast"
-   "List health systems with 'Medical Center' in their name"

### For Conferences

-   "Find conferences happening in Q4 2023"
-   "Which conferences are in Chicago?"
-   "Show me conferences related to oncology"
-   "List all virtual conferences"

## AI Provider Toggle

The AI feature supports two AI providers:

-   **OpenAI (default)**: Uses GPT models for more nuanced understanding
-   **Gemini**: Google's AI alternative

You can toggle between providers using the model selector in either interface.

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Be specific**: The more specific your request, the better the AI can filter your data
2. **Use natural language**: No need for specific formats or keywords
3. **Combine criteria**: You can ask for multiple filters in a single query
4. **Refine gradually**: Start broad and then narrow down with follow-up questions

## Troubleshooting

If you're not getting the expected results:

-   Try rephrasing your question
-   Be more specific about what you're looking for
-   Check if the data you're looking for exists in your CRM
-   Ensure your OpenAI or Gemini API key is properly configured

## Setup

To set up the AI feature, refer to the `setup-env.md` file for instructions on configuring API keys.
